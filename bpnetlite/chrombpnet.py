class ChromBPNet(torch.nn.Module):
	"""A ChromBPNet model.

	ChromBPNet is an extension of BPNet to handle chromatin accessibility data,
	in contrast to the protein binding data that BPNet handles. The distinction
	between these data types is that an enzyme used in DNase-seq and ATAC-seq
	experiments itself has a soft sequence preference, meaning that the
	strength of the signal is driven by real biology but that the exact read
	mapping locations are driven by the soft sequence bias of the enzyme.

	ChromBPNet handles this by treating the data using two models: a bias
	model that is initially trained on background (non-peak) regions where
	the bias dominates, and an accessibility model that is subsequently trained
	using a frozen version of the bias model. The bias model learns to remove
	the enzyme bias so that the accessibility model can learn real motifs.


	Parameters
	----------
	bias: torch.nn.Module 
		This model takes in sequence and outputs the shape one would expect in 
		ATAC-seq data due to Tn5 bias alone. This is usually a BPNet model
		from the bpnet-lite repo that has been trained on GC-matched non-peak
		regions.

	accessibility: torch.nn.Module
		This model takes in sequence and outputs the accessibility one would 
		expect due to the components of the sequence, but also takes in a cell 
		representation which modifies the parameters of the model, hence, 
		"dynamic." This model is usually a DynamicBPNet model, defined below.

	name: str
		The name to prepend when saving the file.

		validation_iter: int
			The number of training batches to perform before doing another
			round of validation. Set higher to spend a higher percentage of
			time in the training step.

		early_stopping: int or None

			max_epochs is reached. If an integer, continue training until that
			number of `validation_iter` ticks has been hit without improvement
