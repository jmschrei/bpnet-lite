class BPNet(torch.nn.Module):
	"""A basic BPNet model with stranded profile and total count prediction.

	This is a reference implementation for BPNet models. It exactly matches the
	architecture in the official ChromBPNet repository. It is very similar to
	the implementation in the official basepairmodels repository but differs in
	when the activation function is applied for the resifual layers. See the
	BasePairNet object below for an implementation that matches that repository. 

	The model takes in one-hot encoded sequence, runs it through: 

	(1) a single wide convolution operation 

	THEN 

	(2) a user-defined number of dilated residual convolutions

	THEN

	(3a) profile predictions done using a very wide convolution layer 
	that also takes in stranded control tracks 

	AND

	(3b) total count prediction done using an average pooling on the output
	from 2 followed by concatenation with the log1p of the sum of the
	stranded control tracks and then run through a dense layer.

	This implementation differs from the original BPNet implementation in
	two ways:

	(1) The model concatenates stranded control tracks for profile
	prediction as opposed to adding the two strands together and also then
	smoothing that track 

	(2) The control input for the count prediction task is the log1p of
	the strand-wise sum of the control tracks, as opposed to the raw
	counts themselves.

	(3) A single log softmax is applied across both strands such that
	the logsumexp of both strands together is 0. Put another way, the
	two strands are concatenated together, a log softmax is applied,
	and the MNLL loss is calculated on the concatenation. 

	(4) The count prediction task is predicting the total counts across
	both strands. The counts are then distributed across strands according
	to the single log softmax from 3.


	Parameters
	----------
	n_filters: int, optional
		The number of filters to use per convolution. Default is 64.

	n_layers: int, optional
		The number of dilated residual layers to include in the model.
		Default is 8.

	n_outputs: int, optional
		The number of profile outputs from the model. Generally either 1 or 2 
		depending on if the data is unstranded or stranded. Default is 2.

	n_control_tracks: int, optional
		The number of control tracks to feed into the model. When predicting
		TFs, this is usually 2. When predicting accessibility, this is usualy
		0. When 0, this input is removed from the model. Default is 2.

	alpha: float, optional
		The weight to put on the count loss.

	profile_output_bias: bool, optional
		Whether to include a bias term in the final profile convolution.
		Removing this term can help with attribution stability and will usually
		not affect performance. Default is True.

	count_output_bias: bool, optional
		Whether to include a bias term in the linear layer used to predict
		counts. Removing this term can help with attribution stability but
		may affect performance. Default is True.

	name: str or None, optional
		The name to save the model to during training.

	trimming: int or None, optional
		The amount to trim from both sides of the input window to get the
		output window. This value is removed from both sides, so the total
		number of positions removed is 2*trimming.

	verbose: bool, optional
		Whether to display statistics during training. Setting this to False
		will still save the file at the end, but does not print anything to
		screen during training. Default is True.
