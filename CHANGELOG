=============

bpnet cmd
---------

	- Made the `bpnet evaluate` command more robust


performance
-----------

	- Fixed a minor bug with count loss shapes
	- Fixed an issue with dtypes not being correctly assigned in _kl_divergence

io
----

Version 0.9.2
=============

bpnet cmd
---------

	- Reorganized imports to make `bpnet pipeline-json` immediate
	- Added a large number of print statements if verbose is True
	- Added an evaluation at the end of the `fit` command to report validation set performance measures
	- Added an `evaluate` command that runs a model on a provided set and reports performance measures
	- Added a reverse complement averaging function to the prediction command
	- Changed default `negative_ratio` to 0.333.
	- Changed the `alpha` parameter to `count_loss_weight` for interpretability
	- If not provided, `count_loss_weight` will be automatically derived from training data as mean(reads_in_peaks) / n_peaks.
	- Set `scheduler` to True by default
	- When `scheduler` is True, use a ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler that halves the LR every 5 iterations without improvement
	- Set default early stopping to 10
	- Added in an optional argument for exclusion lists, where peaks and negatives overlapping them are removed

bpnet
-----

	- Changed `alpha` to `count_loss_weight`
	- Reorganized code to make the `fit` function easier to follow
	- Added in an internal `_mixture_loss` that ensures consistency in calculating the multinomial
	- Added in gradient clipping at a norm of 0.5
	- Added in option (default True) to only calculate profile loss on peaks
	- Calculate validation loss only at the end of every epoch
	- Removes the `validation_iter` argument

performance
-----------

	- Changed `calculate_performance_measures` to internally normalize logits and also to sum counts across all strands to match the model
	

io
----

	- Replaced the DataGenerator with PeakNegativeSampler
	- PeakNegativeSampler takes in a set of peaks and separately a set of negatives and sample from these sets according to a provided ratio, rather than trying to merge the two into a single list
	- PeakGenerator now extracts peaks and negatives separately and passes them into PeakNegativeSampler.
	- Filters out regions based on an optionally provided exclusion list
	- Filters out regions whose signal is larger than the 99th percentile multiplied by 1.2. This multiplication means that if the top 1st percentile is all similar, nothing is filtered out.





Version 0.9.1
=============

Highlights
----------

	- Improved documentation in losses.py and performance.py
	- Cast X as float in ChromBPNet code
	- Improved automatic trimming logic based on actual receptive field
	- When using ChromBPNet, resizes the bias model predictions when it is a 
	different size than the accessibility model
	- Add negative sampling ratio to the dataloader and BPNet training code
	- Add optional learning rate scheduler to BPNet training



Version 0.9.0
=============

Highlights
----------

	- Added support for specifying what device to use within the JSONs
	- Added support for specifying what dtype to use within the JSONs

pipeline-json
-------------

	- Added a new command-line function "pipeline-json"
	- This function takes in filepaths to input data and generates a pipeline JSON
	that can be modified or immediately run.

pipeline
--------

	- Added support for processing .BAM/.SAM/.tsv/.tsv.gz files into stranded or
	unstranded bigWigs before training the BPNet model using bam2bw
	- Added support for calculating GC-matched negatives regions from the provided
	peak file and FASTA file.



Version 0.8.1
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Added robustness toward other characters in the nucleotide alphabet.
	Anything not A, C, G, or T gets ignored. This robustness has been added to
	PeakGenerator and the command line arguments.



Version 0.8.0
==============

Highlights
----------

	- When training ChromBPNet bias models from the command line and no loci
	are provided for training the bias model, the default is changed to inherit
	from `negatives` instead of `loci`. Colloquially, when the user provides a
	set of negatives and peak loci to train ChromBPNet, the default is now that
	the bias model will be trained on the negatives instead of incorrectly on
	the peaks.
	- When calculating the maximum number of reads a negative region can have
	when training the bias model, changed from using the minimum number of reads
	in the peaks to the 1st quantile of reads because it is more robust.



Version 0.7.4
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Re-added the `attribute.py` file back in with a `deep_lift_shap` function
	that wraps tangermeme's function but passes in the layers that must be
	registered. 



Version 0.7.3
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Added `BasePairNet` in `bpnetlite.bpnet` which is an implementation of the
	model from the official `basepairmodels`
	- Added `BasePairNet.from_bpnet` to load TensorFlow-trained models from
	`basepairmodels` into the PyTorch wrapper
	- Removed a few dependencies that are no longer needed after using
	tangermeme



Version 0.7.2
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Complete inclusion of tangermeme as the backend for operations
	- Remove the `predict` method for models in favor of `tangermeme.predict`
	- Remove attribute.py in favor of `tangermeme.deep_lift_shap`
	- Remove marginalization functions in favor of `tangermeme.marginalize`
	- Remove plotting functions in favor of `tangermeme.plot`
	- Alter the `bpnet` and `chrombpnet` command-line tools to account for
	these changes.
	- Add in `_Log` and `_Exp` as layers for the ChromBPNet model so that they
	can be registered as non-linear functions for `deep_lift_shap`.



Version 0.7.1
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Begin inclusion of tangermeme into the backend.



Version 0.7.0
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Changed the function name from `calculate_attributions` to `attribute`
	to be more in line with the `predict` and `marginalize` functions. The
	functionality and usage should be the same.
	- Changed the nomenclature from "interpret" to "attribute" to be more
	consistent with the name of the function and what is used colloquially.



Version 0.6.0
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Replaced the negative sampling code with a simpler approach that only
	considers bins of signal rather than operates at bp resolution. This code
	is much faster and more robust but may produce slightly worse GC matches.
	- The negative sampling code now allows you to pass in a bigwig so that
	only regions that pass a threshold are selected.



Version 0.5.7
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Changed the `warning_threshold` argument to only print a warning rather
	than end the process when the model exceeds it.
	- Added support for plotting annotations alongside `plot_attributions` 
	- Fixed various minor bugs.



Version 0.5.6
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Changed the shape of the returned one-hot encoded sequences to match
	the documentation.
	- Fixed an issue with dinucleotide shuffling when not all nucleotides
	are present.



Version 0.5.5
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Fixed an issue with ChromBPNet reading.



Version 0.5.4
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Added in reading of TensorFlow-formatted ChromBPNet models from the
	official repo using the `from_chrombpnet` commands to the BPNet and
	ChromBPNet objects.



Version 0.5.2
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Fixed issue where non-linear operations in DeepLiftShap were not
	registered correctly and hence causing minor divergences. Through the
	use of an ugly wrapper object this has been fixed.
	- Added in `print_convergence_deltas` and `warning_threshold` to the
	`calculate_attributions` function and the `DeepLiftShap` object. The first
	will print convergence deltas for every example that gets explained and the
	second will raise a warning if the divergence is higher than it.



Version 0.5.0
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Extended support for the `chrombpnet` command-line tool
	- Now has mirrored functionality of the `bpnet` command-line tool
	- `chrombpnet pipeline` now mirrors `bpnet pipeline` except that it will
	run each of the reports on each of the three models: the full ChromBPNet
	model, the accessibility model, and the bias model. It will train a bias
	model and an accessibility model if not provided.
	- Changed the ChromBPNet object to be compatible with the `bpnet` command
	options.
	- Fixed issue with attributions where performance would degrade over time.



Version 0.4.0
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Extended support for the `bpnet` command-line tool
	- Added in `marginalize` command-line option for generating those reports
	- Added in `pipeline` command-line option for running a full pipeline from
    model training to inference, attribution, tfmodisco, and marginalization



Version 0.3.0
==============

Highlights
----------

	- I forgot.



Version 0.2.0
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Addition of a `ChromBPNet` model
	- Addition of an explicit, shared, `Logger` class
	- "Peak" semantics have been switched to "locus" semantics


chrombpnet.py
-------------

	- Newly added.
	- This file contains the `ChromBPNet` class, which is a wrapper that
	takes in two BPNet objects: a pre-trained bias model, and an untrained
	accessibility model, and specifies the training procedure for training
	the accessibility model.


io.py
-----

	- The semantics of "peaks", e.g. `extract_peaks`, has been changed to loci,
	e.g. `extract_loci`, and the associated keywords (now `loci` from `peaks`)
	can take in a list or tuple of files to interleave them. This means you
	can now train on peaks and background regions.


logging.py
----------

	- Newly added.
	- This file contains the `Logger` class which is a simple way to record
	and display statistics during training.
